                <h1>Instructions for using GitHub</h1>
                <h2>Why should use Git/GitHub?</h2>
                <p>Most of the time, when asking students about working on group assignments,
                    where each member codes a specific part, how do they combine everything into a complete project?</p>

                <p>
                    Most students usually respond: 'We'll meet at the library or some other place to piece it together
                    or copy and share with each other.' There are also cases where they say, 'There's always someone
                    carrying the team, so I just need to work on the documentation. :D
                </p>

                <p>
                    This situation shows that most fresh graduates, who lack work experience, are often very confused
                    about using Git. Some may not even know what Git is or how to work with it. From my perspective,
                    this isn’t entirely their fault—it’s simply because they haven’t had the opportunity to use Git and
                    therefore haven’t explored it. However, it will be their fault if they fail to learn about Git when
                    working on a project that requires it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recently, I had the opportunity to train a few interns and encountered similar situations as
                    mentioned earlier. Therefore, I’d like to share some of my knowledge and experiences (from what I’ve
                    learned and practiced) about Git in this article. I hope it will help others feel more confident
                    working with Git and enhance their skills on the journey to becoming professional developers."
                </p>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h1>What is Git?</h1>
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system (Distributed Version Control System). Simply put, Git is
                    a system that helps manage documents, source code, and more for a group of developers working on the
                    same project. Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to the project's source code. Whether
                    you edit a file, add a line of code, delete a line, or even leave an extra character somewhere—Git
                    records all these actions. This makes it easier to investigate the root causes of system errors and
                    to integrate code efficiently.
                </p>


                <h1>Instructions for Git</h1>
                <p>Before diving into using Git, it’s important to understand some concepts related to Git as follows:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <strong>Repository</strong>: <strong>Repository</strong> Simply put, it is a repository that stores
                    all the necessary information to manage changes
                    and history of entry project <strong>Repository</strong> of Git are divided into two types:
                    <strong>remote repository</strong> and <strong>local repository</strong>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>=> <strong>GitHub</strong>
                    is a Remote Repository that stores all the necessary information to manage changes and the complete
                    history of the entire project.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Working tree và Index (or staging area): </strong>
                    Are directories managed by Git, where everyone performs their work, commonly referred to
                    as<strong>working tree</strong>.
                    Repository and <strong>working tree</strong> exist in a place called the index or staging area.
                    staging area is where changes are prepared before committing them to the repository.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Let go now!!!</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "To install Git, you just need to download Git and click Next => Next => ... => Finish (for Windows
                    machines). For detailed instructions, you can refer to the following link.
                    <a href=" : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git"> :
                        https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    After installation, we can get started. In this part, I will introduce some basic commands and
                    operations with the local repository first (without needing to create a GitHub account yet). This
                    way, we can understand the theory and practice it right away to help remember it better :D.
